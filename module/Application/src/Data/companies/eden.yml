cv-careerGoals-content:
    en_GB: "Dear Eden. I am really sorry about last time, but I just couldn't handle everything at one time. I hope you are not angry with me and we can still work together :) Last time have you sent me and offer and I didn't follow it. Is it still available / open? If yes, I am interested. I have prepared possibility to customize CV (to make it more personal), like this example, so if you send me the name of person responsible for hiring (interview), I will personalize CV for you. I also prepared Cover Letter template, so I can send it when it is needed. You can see it here: http://en.cv.creolink.pl/documents/cover_letter_template.pdf - if you have any comments or suggestions, please do not hesitate to write them."
    de_DE: 'Bitte lesen Sie diese CV auf English.'
    pl_PL: 'Proszę przeczytać to CV po angielsku.'
